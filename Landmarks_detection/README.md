<h1 align="center">Landmarks detection</h1>

## Description
Purpose of this project is to build CNN model to detect 192 facial landmarks by photos of people. It was made for kaggle competition using Google colab GPU.
## Results
Code, presented in [pretrained_tuning.ipynb](https://github.com/SergeyMaslikhov/DS_projects/blob/main/Landmarks_detection/pretrained_tuning.ipynb) is capable of:
- Loading pretrained resnext model
- Preprocessing and scaling input images
- Creating class to apply images to model
- Fine-tuning and train/validate model
## Requirements
To install necessary packages use:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
