## Description
Purpose of this project is building ensemble of regression models to predict fraction of reservoir volume occupied by hydrocarbon-bearing rocks.
## Results
Code, presented in [ntg_predicting.ipynb](https://github.com/SergeyMaslikhov/DS_projects/blob/main/NTG_project/ntg_predicting.ipynb) is capable of:
- Feature engineering and analyzing
- Implementing greedy algorith of feature selection
- Optimizing hyperparameters with Bayesian optimization
- Building ensemble based on stacking and averaging models
## Requirements
To install necessary packages use:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
