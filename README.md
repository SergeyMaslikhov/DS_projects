## Overview
This repository includes several jupyther notebooks with pet projects. All projects are based on different machine learning methods.
### Brief description for each:
- [Landmarks detection](https://github.com/SergeyMaslikhov/DS_projects/tree/main/Landmarks_detection) - detection of face landmarks using pretrained convolutional neural network, fine-tuned for the given dataset.

- [NTG project](https://github.com/SergeyMaslikhov/DS_projects/tree/main/NTG_project) - regression task for predicting net-to-gross values of wells by their coordinates using KNN, XGBoost, CatBoost and Bayesian optimization for hyperparameters.

- [Sampling research](https://github.com/SergeyMaslikhov/DS_projects/tree/main/Sampling_research) - research using sampling techinques to balance objects distribution by classes in text classification task. Four text samples and five machine learning classificators were taken and checked if using sampling techniques is justified.

- [Chatbot HSE](https://github.com/SergeyMaslikhov/DS_projects/tree/main/chatbot_HSE) - model to answer questions related to organization matters for students of MIEM HSE. Pretrained BERT models were used as baseline to compute cosine distance between input question and those we have in sample. Also pipeline for training on new data were developed.
